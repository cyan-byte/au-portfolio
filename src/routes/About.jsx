        So, I’m Alisha . . . a Digital Designer with knowledge of Frontend
        Development (that’s a bonus). This means that I can design an entire UI
        and communicate with developers about feasibility.

        I first start with an idea or a brief, rather. Then I move onto creating
        a sitemap. From that comes a wireframe, which gets translated into a
        visually appealing interface using one of my favorites: Figma.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work from a design system, creating text style guides and color
        systems for consistency. Don’t forget the ever-useful components! If
        necessary, why not throw in a little animation too?
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        Now I come from the closed captioning world, so I have an ability to
        independently manage projects with minimal supervision.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        Let’s not forget about collaboration, though. I also come from the
        retail warehouse industry where I learned the beauty of working on teams
        in a professional setting. I was a member of a 5-person Inventory
        Control team. We all worked on the same body of inventory whole managing
        our own assigned zones, so naturally, our work would intertwine.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>
        I was also part of a 6-person Cycle Count team. We’d count the inventory
        of 2 neighboring warehouses together and pick up the pieces if anyone
        fell short.
      </p>{" "}
      <p>They were all some really cool people.</p>{" "}
      <p>
        I’m no stranger to remote work. I recently completed a software
        engineering bootcamp with over 20 people via Zoom. We met for 15 weeks
        straight from 9am -4pm, Monday through Friday. I made some new friends
        and connections there too.

        P.S. I’d appreciate feedback on this portfolio site design. What do you
        think? Good or bad, email me about it.
